Reads data from a .txt file and allows the user to display and sort the data in various ways

This was a part of my coursework for Java. It was created to practice using lightweight objects, or "records." I created the .txt file using excel, and then exporting it tab spaced. The program reads the data and puts it into an array, then manipulates it using some methods I created. The code is kind of messy because it had to be all in a single file for the project, but it works exactly as intended. All the output is to the consol.
